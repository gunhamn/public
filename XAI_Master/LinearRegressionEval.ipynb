    "A baseline is established. Between one good red agent and one week green agent, the decision tree managed to predict 78.4% of the cases correctly based on only neuron activations from, fc1, the second last layer with 128 neurons. When also giving the tree the coordinates for the agent, red and greens chests, the tree performed much better, only failing at 2-6 of 2000 test cases. (Depending on random seed)\n",
