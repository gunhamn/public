AE-BASIC Implement the autoencoder, learn from standard MNIST data, and show reconstruction results. 1

AE-GEN
Show results for the AE-as-a-generator task on standard MNIST data. In addition to example images, the quality and coverage should also be reported. 1

AE-ANOM Show results for the AE-as-an-anomaly-detector task on MNIST data. Show the top-k anomalous examples from the test set. 1

AE-STACK
Show the results for the AE-GEN and AE-ANOM tasks when learning from StackedMNIST data. Be prepared to discuss how you adapted the model structure when going from one to three color channels. 2

VAE-BASIC Implement the variational autoencoder, learn from standard MNIST data, and show reconstruction results. 1

VAE-GEN Show results for the VAE-as-a-generator task on MNIST data. 1

VAE-ANOM
Show results for the VAE-as-an-anomaly-detector task on MNIST data. NOTE! This is different from the AE-ANOM code. Simply doing the same as for the AE will give zero points. 1

VAE-STACK Show the results for the VAE-GEN and VAE-ANOM tasks when learning from StackedMNIST data. 2
